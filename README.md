==========

Capture and replay execution traces of client-side web applications

# API

## Reanimator.capture
**Capture non-deterministic input**

Call this method to begin logging non-deterministic input to your
JavaScript application. To capture a useful log, you must call
`Reanimator.capture` before such input occurs, but after libraries like
jQuery have been loaded.

The log is reset whenever this method is called.

## Reanimator.replay
**Replay a log of non-deterministic input**

### Arguments

- `log` - *object* - the log to replay, in the format emitted by
  `Reanimator.flush`
- `config` - *object* - configuration object
  - `config.delay` - *string* | *integer* - how long Reanimator should wait
    before replaying the next event in the log
      
      For a fixed delay, specify the number of ms between steps (the
      default is 0). If the string `'realtime'` is specified, Reanimator
      will make a good faith effort to replay the events with the actual
      delays recorded in the log.

## Reanimator.flush
**Return a copy of the current log**

Returns a copy of the current log as an object with the following
properties:

- `dates` - [ *number* ] - captured dates, specified in ms since the epoch
- `random` - [ *number* ] - captured random numbers generated by
  `Math.random`
- `events` - [ *object* ] - captured callback invocations

    Each element is an object with the following properties:
  - `type` - *string* - the type of the recorded callback
  - `time` - *number* - the time the callback was fired (ms since the epoch)
  - `details` - *any* - any additional details necessary to replay the
    callback

## Reanimator.cleanUp
**Stop capturing or replaying and restore native methods and objects**

This method does *not* clear the most recent log.

## Reanimator.plug
**Install a plugin to capture and replay some non-deterministic input**

### Arguments

- `type` - *string* - a unique string corresponding to the `type` property
  of any events the plugin will log
- `plugin` - *object* - the plugin to install

A plugin is an object that implements the following methods:

- `init`: initialize the plugin

    Called once, by `plug`

    Arguments
  - `native` - *object* - an object to store a reference to any native
    methods or objects the plugin interposes on

- `capture`: prepare to capture the input the plugin is responsible for

    Called by `Reanimator.capture`

- `cleanUp` - restore any native methods or objects the plugin interposed
  on

- `beforeReplay` - prepare to replay

    **Optional**; called by `Reanimator.replay` immediately before the
    first event is replayed

    Arguments
  - `log` - *object* - the log to be replayed
  - `config` - *object* - the replay configuration

- `replay` - replay a captured event

    **Required** if the plugin logs to `events`, **optional** otherwise

    Arguments
  - `event` - *object* - the event to replay, in the format specified above
    in `Reanimator.flush`
